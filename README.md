# Instructions

Please read the instructions before you begin.  
This experiment will take approximately 3 to 5 minutes to complete.

## Prerequisites

- You must have a 64-bit computer running Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows
- You must use a mouse to perform this experiment
   - All other input methods (trackpad, touch screen, stylus, etc.) are prohibited
   - If you do not have a mouse, you are not eligible for this experiment

## Downloading the game
1. Download the build for your platform [here](https://github.com/bcout/HCI-Project/releases/tag/Builds)
2. Extract the game to a location of your choosing
3. Run the executable included in the downloaded folder

## Playing the game
1. Enter your name, or leave it blank to have a random ID assigned to you
2. The person who gave you this experiment also gave you a letter, A to F. Select the button that contains the letter you were given.
3. Press "Start" when you are ready to perform the experiment

There will be 6 rounds, and the goal is the same for each: Use your mouse to click on as many targets as possible before the timer runs out.
- Once a round is complete, you may take a break before clicking "Next Round", however we ask that you do not wait too long between rounds.

## Finishing the game
Once all rounds are complete:
1. Navigate to the `{executable name}_data/` folder present next to the executable you ran
2. Locate a file called "results.txt"
3. Send that file to the person who gave you these instructions

That is all!
